Project Details
---------------
Project Title: DE2 Tron

Project Description: A variation of the classic Tron game using Verilog and the Altera DE2 board. This is a four-player
arcade game where players try to cut each other off as they maneuver bikes that leave trails behind them across the screen.

Proposal
--------

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the first lab session?:
- Keyboard input functionality for the game, preferably at least 'WASD' and the Arrow Keys
- If that goes well we want to 'TFGH' and 'IJKL' as direction inputs as well
- Display output of keyboard on DE2 board's HEX displays
- Create the .mif file for the background for the VGA adapter

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the second lab session?:
- Implement VGA output using the registers as values for RGB in the grid
- Implement grid registers and test by assigning values to the registers
- each cell in our grid will be represented by a 3 bit register, we have as many cells as we want given the screen size
- 001 : Player 1 trail
  010 : Player 2 trail
  011 : Player 3 trail
  100 : Player 4 trail
  default : empty cell
- Pushing '010' to register at (X, Y) should light up that cell with Player 2's colour etc.

What do you plan to have completed by the end of the third lab session?:
- Implement hit box detection for the player and trails (if a player ends up on a cell that is not default, their game is over)
- The player's bike acts as a trail cell itself for hit detection purposes and at any time if more than one player attempts to
  enter the same cell, they all lose
- The last player still in game wins and the game ends
- Hitting the edge of the field causes the player to lose

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?:
- We will have the game working with one player using either the keyboard or the switches and we will have a counter
to count how many seconds the player lives in the game (essentially will turn into a variation of snake)

What hardware will you need beyond the DE2 board?:
We will need the VGA Monitor and a PS/2 Keyboard


Motivations
-----------
How does this project relate to the material covered in CSCB58?:
- It will cover material like registers, clock cycles, FSM's, and arithmetic operations from class and allows us to understand it in further detail.
  This lets us incorporate things we like to allow us to have fun while learning.

Why is this project interesting/cool (for CSCB58 students, and for non CSCB58 students?):
- It is a take on a classic and highly replayable game that you can play with your friends
- It showcases a variety of hardware, especially the FPGA boards and its ability to interface with various input
  and output devices

Why did you personally choose this project?:
- This game has not been implemented as a B58 or 258 project that we know of and it is a challenging project that will put
  our skills to the test
